# Finding Even and Odd Numbers Using Multiple Threads

This Java code aims to find even and odd numbers in a large dataset using multiple threads.

## Process Steps

1. An ArrayList containing numbers from 1 to 10,000 is created.
2. This ArrayList is divided into four equal parts.
3. Each part is processed by a separate Thread.
4. Each Thread finds the even numbers in its part and adds them to an ArrayList.
5. The found even numbers are combined in a common ArrayList.
6. The same process is also performed for odd numbers.

This code demonstrates how to efficiently use multiple threads.
